## Step-by-step guide
This short guide will show you how to get the source version of the program up and running.

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
2. Open Command Prompt (or Terminal, depending on your OS).
3. Type in the following command: `pip install mutagen musicbrainzngs youtube_dl pyperclip validators Pillow`.
4. Download [`audiojack.py`](https://github.com/Blue9/AudioJack/blob/master/audiojack.py) and place it in a folder of your choice (you will be running the program from this folder, so I suggest you pick a folder other than your default downloads folder).
5. Download [`audiojack_gui.py`](https://github.com/Blue9/AudioJack-GUI/blob/master/audiojack_gui.py) and [`AudioJack Icon.ico`](https://github.com/Blue9/AudioJack-GUI/blob/master/AudioJack%20Icon.ico) and place them in the same folder as `audiojack.py`.
6. Download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place the files `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `ffplay` in the same directory as your AudioJack files.
7. Navigate Command Prompt to the folder and run `python audiojack_gui.py`.

Whenever you want to run the program, just repeat step 7.
